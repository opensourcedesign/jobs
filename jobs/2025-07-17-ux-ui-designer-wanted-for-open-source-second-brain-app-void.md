VOID is an open-source, local-first second-brain app built with Rust, Vue, and Tauri — inspired by Notion and Obsidian, but designed to be truly yours.

We’re looking for a UX/UI designer to help shape the user experience and visual identity of the app as we move toward our first public alpha. The work includes designing the core editing interface (WYSIWYG Markdown editor), dashboard layout system, theming, plugin system UX, and improving overall visual clarity and usability.

You’ll be working closely with a passionate solo developer who’s building this as a full-time commitment, with the support of a small team ready to assist when needed.

We aim to create something beautiful, powerful, and fully hackable — and your input can shape how people use knowledge tools in the future.

We are seeking volunteers to help build  Virtual Hospital to be deployed to remote areas where traditional hospitals are either unreachable or unaffordable. The Virtual Hospital will consist of the following modules:


1. Patient Application
2. Nurse Application
3. Virtual Doctor Application
4. Community Health Worker/Caregiver Application.
5. Virtual Ward
6. Whatsapp chatbot to facilitate interaction with third party service providers like Pharmacists, Laboratorists, Radiographers and other Specialists.

There will also be a need to integrate at least 8 bluetooth connected diagnostic tools to the software. These include weight scales, thermometers, spirimeters etc. The project has the potential to be an ongoing project as more tools are added and a Proactive Healthcare application for screening diseases is added.

ðŸš€ Join Us at PatternedAI! UX Designer for AI-Powered Pattern Mockups ðŸš€

About Us
Weâ€™re PatternedAI (ðŸ”— patterned.ai), the go-to platform for seamless AI-generated patterns. From fashion to packaging, our users turn ideas into stunning designs in secondsâ€”and weâ€™re just getting started!

What Youâ€™ll Do

Prototype Fast: Within 72 h of each brief, research similar AI workflows, map out the user journey, and spin up a low-fi prototype.

Bring Ideas to Life: Show us your vision via a short Loom walkthroughâ€”no surprise meetings, just crisp async demos.

Iterate to Perfection: Tackle feedback head-on, refine flows in real time, and nail down every interaction.

Ship Dev-Ready Designs: Deliver pixel-perfect Figma files so our engineers can build without guesswork.

Why Youâ€™ll Love It

100% Remote & Async: Work from anywhereâ€”daily check-ins are just bullet-points + Looms.

Speed + Impact: Move at the pace of hours, not weeks, and see your designs live in front of real users.

Cutting-Edge AI: Shape the future of pattern design by integrating AI mockup generators directly into our site.

Must-Haves

3+ end-to-end shipped features (discovery â†’ design â†’ launch) on mobile/web/desktop.

Proven ability to go from concept to Figma files in under 72 h.

Expert level Figma skills + experience with at least one AI-assisted design tool.

Background building design systems for text + image products.

Comfort with quick Loom demos and async collaboration.

NOTE: Applications without your Loom video wonâ€™t be considered.

How We Work

Async First: Looms > meetings.

Bias to Action: We think in hours, not sprints.

ðŸŽ¬ Application Challenge
Loom Video (â‰¤ 2 min)
Visit our site patterned.ai and imagine a brand-new feature: AI-powered mockup generator that takes any pattern and turns it into realistic product mockups. Record a Loom showing how youâ€™d integrate this feature into our UXâ€”where it lives, how users discover it, and the key interaction flow.

AI Tool Insight
Whatâ€™s your favorite AI image generator, one UX tweak youâ€™d make, and why?

ChatGPT Makeover
Bullet-list 3 changes youâ€™d apply to ChatGPTâ€™s UI to make it image-first.

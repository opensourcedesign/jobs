Muchrooms is a new(ish) project, it is a Jabber/XMPP group chat implementation in Rust. It focuses on testing, moderation and privacy. I recently got a grant from NLnet to work on it.

The design work would consist in creating a logo (vectorised) for the project to use.

I am not much of a design person and I'm not sure what directions to set, feel free to ask more questions and propose ideas yourself.

Jabber/XMPP is a standard communication protocol. It features at its core federation and extensibility. It would be nice for this to be reflected in the work.

I have in mind either various islands of mushrooms linked together somehow.
Or, some variant of the XMPP logo overrun by mycelium.

I don't want the logo to look too realistic visually (as in, close to a photograph).

Even though I do have a grand for working on the project, I regret not to have factored this in, and this is the little I can spare with nonexistent salary otherwise.

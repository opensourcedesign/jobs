Forgejo is a self-hosted platform for software development (version tracking and project management).

Dear design community, I'm looking for assistance for my role in the Forgejo user research team. Currently, I'm the only member of that team, and I [publicly called for help](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/discussions/issues/323) with my roles recently, because I cannot keep up with the work on my own.

So far, my work consisted of doing user research and user testing via live interviews as well as creating surveys, to learn more about the usage of Forgejo and similar platforms. The results have been recorded in a dedicated repository. The information is then used to influence design of new features and classify feature requests based on their expected value.

The results of user research have been overall handled respectfully by the Forgejo contributors, within the human capacity the project has to turn suggestions into actual improvements.

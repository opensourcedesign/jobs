title: Orchard Core CMS admin UX revamp
role: web design
compensation: paid
deliverables: "- Find a suitable open-source Bootstrap dashboard theme/template as a base. We'll need to build a somewhat custom admin story, but not from the ground up (including neither design work nor coding).\r\n- Figure out the basic Orchard Core-specific UX principles the admin should follow. Provide these as guidelines that any competent web developer can understand and extend the admin with.\r\n\r\nOnce these are delivered, developer contributors would update a single piece of UI to be our perfect role model (like the basic content item editor), and the menu structure (or rather, the whole navigation story). The rest of the UI will be kept more or less as-is, but with updated common visuals (coming from the theme) and quick wins (e.g. common pieces like buttons, hints, labels, fields, will all be updated just by updating the common classes, or with search and replace).\r\n\r\nWe'll then release it as part of a major version. In the future, perhaps, maybe, follow the role model in all existing UI, and definitely in new UI. But whatever we'll have will be good enough at this point."

We're looking for a UX professional to renew the admin (dashboard) experience of the CMS Orchard Core, i.e. where the owners of a site edit content, manage users, change settings, etc. If you enjoy open-source, have worked with such projects before, and perhaps want to get your name on another one as a contributor, then this can be you! (Being a developer, even a frontend one, is NOT necessary, we'd write the code. But if you do code, then all the better.)

[Orchard Core](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore) is an open-source, community-driven framework and CMS built on ASP.NET Core. It's among the most active .NET open-source projects.

The admin looks something [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gARrrvoAY4&list=PLuskKJW0FhJcSX7j0Bd-1X5hq3dgCtYwO&index=5) currently. We don't think we want to rebuild it down to the last pixel, but rather, we'd need new foundations, better ways for the usual, common UI elements (like navigation, notifications, forms...), and guidelines on how to keep it consistent. The goal is for us to have a modern admin UX that's functional, convenient, and unobtrusive, and something that ordinary contributors can extend by following patterns. We don't want to have to awkwardly explain to newcomers that, well, this was built by developers for developers, don't expect top UX on the admin, it's rough not just around the edges.

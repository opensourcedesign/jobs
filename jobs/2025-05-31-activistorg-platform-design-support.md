The [activist community](https://github.com/activist-org/activist) is actively developing the platform activist.org, a platform that enables more people to safely engage in activism by making it easy to discover organizations and events as well as coordinate and collaborate on political action. We want to enable activists to learn proven and novel strategies from each other for social and ecological change. Free, open-source, privacy-focused and governed by our community.

We're looking for general design support for the development of the platform. The current Figma designs can be found via the following link:

There are many parts of the designs that haven't been finalized yet, and lots of minor issues that have been fixed in the code, but haven't been updated in the designs. The goal would be to develop relationships with one or more designers so that we can collaborate as needed. The idea would be that we'd use our private Figma file and once designs are finished they'll be moved over to the public one :)

**Organization:** PySeas *(soon to be PyCeas)*
**Status:** Searching
**Date Posted:** January 26, 2025
**Tagged as:** Logo, Branding, Pixel Art

Hey all, I'm rewriting this post because the game design document wasn't working properly.

Something also came up with the new project name—it’s going to be slightly different! The current project name **PySeas** will officially change to **PyCeas**. This clever nod to **Pisces**, the zodiac sign of the fish, connects the **sea to the stars**, symbolizing both **adventure and mystery**. The alternate spelling makes it unique while keeping its pronunciation and meaning intact. *(Fun fact: It’s also my constellation!)* My brother came up with the name.

**Skills:**
- Experience in **pixel art & branding**.
* Ability to create **simple yet effective branding elements**.
* Understanding of **scalability** for various uses (social media, GitHub, game assets, etc.).
* Familiarity with **game branding** is a plus!

**Compensation:**

- This is an **unpaid, open-source** project, but you’ll receive **full credit** in the game, documentation, and all related materials.

Interested? Let’s collaborate!

Our project aims to create a pirate themed 2D, topdown, turn based boardgame in Pygame.

The new project name with the most votes by our community is Pyces. So I think that could become our new project's name.

The game will utilize pixelart and needs to represent a logo or rebrand to the new github organization structure.

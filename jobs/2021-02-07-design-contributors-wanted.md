The design function at OFN is very new and growing and as such is slow moving. This is a project that needs your design support but much is going to be 'self started' and while Eriol will be there to help guide you through an open source design project there is still a longer embdedding process that design needs to do before it can move through the 'pipeline' of OSS work in OFN quicker.

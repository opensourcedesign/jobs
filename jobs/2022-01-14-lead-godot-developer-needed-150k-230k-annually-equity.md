I'm a third party recruiter that works on full-time placements for well-funded startup ventures. We have been contracted by a startup in Miami to find a Lead and Senior Godot Developer. Godot is an open source game engine and applicable to the audience of Open Source Design. Please share if you know anyone that has the skillset and interest to join this exciting new opportunity. 

DETAILS: My client is building a cross-chain 3D NFT metaverse. Imagine Secondlife but with blockchain technology and 3D NFTs you can interact with in the metaverse. 

It will be a lot of work but it's a first-of-its-kind venture and is backed by an exciting group of investors that have successfully backed equally as ambitious projects in the past.

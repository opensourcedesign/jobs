#About Us
We are on a mission to help end euthanasia in overcrowded animal shelters. I have in mind a mobile app to help bring together a vast network of volunteers who transport rescue animals out of over populated rescues and shelters. I need your help to bring my concept to the screen.

#Type of work
I am looking for initial concept screens to demonstrate the basic MVP. This is very low fidelity work, if you want to take it further you are more than welcome.  
From there, I am looking for screens to demonstrate the beta release. These will require some sort of development ready UI and a demonstrable prototype. 

#About Me
I have been a design manager for the last six years, and as such my hands-on skills are rusty, and we don't want to waste time, that's where you come in. You can read more about me on my linked in. https://www.linkedin.com/in/regandesign/

#Join the team
I am hoping to find someone who not only wants this as a shining star in their portfolio but also has a passion for our cause. We are looking to get this concept green-lit, at which point you could be the lead designer for all of the app UI.

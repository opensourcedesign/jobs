We require designs of our conference logo, designs and wireframes for our website, content layout templates for our blog, designs for a sponsorship brochure and a few other related assets for the general theme and design of the conference.

For sample, our past few yearâ€™s websites:

PyCon India is the premier conference for Python enthusiasts and professionals, offering an unparalleled opportunity to dive deep into the world of Python and explore its limitless potential. PyCon India is a volunteer driven conference and the 2025 edition will be the 16th one to be hosted in India. We are a completely volunteer run non-profit event.

Although we are all volunteers running this conference, we have some budget to pay for the design work.

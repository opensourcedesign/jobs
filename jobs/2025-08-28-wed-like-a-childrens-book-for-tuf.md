  A book which could be sold (you keep all the proceeds), but ideally would be
  available free online.    We do want the rights to post a PDF version or

Want to make a children's book?

The TUF project (a Linux Foundation project under the Cloud Native Computing Foundation) is used to secure a huge swatch of cloud systems, programming languages (Python, Rust), cars, the legal code in Washington DC, Baltimore, etc.  Helping us here will help a critical part of the software infrastructure we all rely on.

One comment we've heard is that the concepts behind TUF are hard to learn.  We really need something to make it easy to understand the system so that we don't scare off people.  We'd be happy to help you to understand TUF so you can make something fun and educational.

There is a history of making children's books in the CNCF, using the project mascots.  (For example, https://www.amazon.com/Phippys-AI-Friend-Workshop-Parents/dp/B0CWYF8JT6 ) Tai the TUF elephant is our mascot: https://www.cncf.io/phippy/  However, using Tai (and the rest of the Phippy and Friends characters) is not a requirement.

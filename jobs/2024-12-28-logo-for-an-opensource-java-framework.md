I'm looking for a kind person that could deliver a logo for my Java framework ;) I'm working on a project after hours, releasing it under MIT license.

I'm doing a port of this library: https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea
So they are having this nice logos for all of their libraries - I need something in similar fasion :)
